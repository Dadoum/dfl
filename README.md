# dfl
This unofficial project is a migration of D Forms Library (DFL) that is managed on SVN.
DFL is a Win32 windowing library for the D language.

# Deprecated
I had a single project utilizing this library. I have moved on to utilizing DWT.

For this reason I will not be working to keep this project compiling in the latest Compiler version.
I would hand this off to other active participants, but as their are none...
